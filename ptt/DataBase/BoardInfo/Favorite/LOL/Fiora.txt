PASSIVE
DUELIST'S DANCE
Fiora challenges nearby enemy Champions to dodge her. She calls out a direction from which she will try to strike. If she can complete her own challenge, she receives a small bonus and calls out a new direction.

Q
LUNGE
Fiora lunges in a direction and stabs a nearby enemy, dealing physical damage and applying on-hit effects.

W
RIPOSTE
Fiora parries all incoming damage and disables for a short time, then stabs in a direction. This stab slows the first enemy champion hit, or stuns them if Fiora blocked an immobilizing effect with this ability.

E
BLADEWORK
Fiora has increased attack speed for the next two attacks. The first attack slows the target, and the second attack will critically strike.

R
GRAND CHALLENGE
Fiora reveals all four Vitals on an enemy champion and gains movement speed while near them. If Fiora hits all 4 Vitals or if the target dies after she has hit at least one, Fiora and her allies in the area are healed over the next few seconds.
