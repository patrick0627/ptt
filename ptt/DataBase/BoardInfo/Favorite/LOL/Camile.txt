PASSIVE
ADAPTIVE DEFENSES
Basic attacks on champions grant a shield equal to a percentage of Camille's maximum health against their damage type (Physical or Magic) for a brief duration.

Q
PRECISION PROTOCOL
Camille's next attack deals bonus damage and grants bonus movement speed. This spell can be recast for a short period of time, doing significantly increased bonus damage if Camille delays a period of time between the two attacks.

W
TACTICAL SWEEP
Camille blasts in a cone after a delay, dealing damage. Enemies in the outer half are slowed and take extra damage, while also healing Camille.

E
HOOKSHOT
Camille pulls herself to a wall, leaping off and knocking up enemy champions upon landing.

R
THE HEXTECH ULTIMATUM
Camille dashes to target champion, anchoring them to the area. She also deals bonus magic damage to the target with her basic attacks.
